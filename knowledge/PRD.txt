# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1\. Overview

**App/Website Name:** Cohort Enrollment

Cohort Enrollment is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline the entire lifecycle of cohort-based learning programs. The platform serves as a centralized hub where learners can discover professional courses, complete secure enrollments with digital payments, and participate in structured learning experiences. It bridges the gap between course organizers and students by providing seamless communication channels, automated administrative processes, and integrated learning management tools.

The platform targets professional learners seeking skill development, educational institutions offering cohort-based programs, and independent course creators looking to scale their training offerings. It solves critical problems including fragmented enrollment processes, manual payment tracking, scattered communication channels, and inefficient certificate distribution systems that plague traditional learning management approaches.
